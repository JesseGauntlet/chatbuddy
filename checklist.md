# ChatBuddy MVP Development Checklist

This checklist outlines the step-by-step process for developing the ChatBuddy MVP based on the PRD. The project consists of an iOS app frontend and a Python backend server.

## Project Setup

- [x] Create basic project directory structure (`ios_app` and `backend` directories)
- [ ] Initialize git repository and create initial commit
- [ ] Create .gitignore file for both Swift and Python projects
- [ ] Set up development environment (Xcode, Python, dependencies)

## Phase 1: Backend Development (Python)

### 1.1 Initial Setup
- [ ] Set up Python virtual environment
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
```
- [ ] Create `requirements.txt` with initial dependencies:
  - Flask/FastAPI
  - OpenAI
  - SQLAlchemy/psycopg2
  - python-dotenv
  - pytest
- [ ] Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- [ ] Create basic server structure:
  - app.py
  - config.py
  - routes/
  - models/
  - services/
  - tests/

### 1.2 Database Setup
- [ ] Design database schema based on PRD
- [ ] Set up SQLite for development (migrate to PostgreSQL later)
- [ ] Implement database models:
  - Users
  - Sessions
  - Messages
  - (Optional) Latency logs

### 1.3 Core Backend Services
- [ ] Create OpenAI service wrapper
- [ ] Implement LLM provider interface (for future provider swapping)
- [ ] Set up user authentication
- [ ] Create session management service
- [ ] Implement conversation history storage and retrieval

### 1.4 API Endpoints
- [ ] Set up API routes:
  - User registration/login
  - Session creation/retrieval
  - Message sending/receiving
  - Audio transcription (optional if handled on-device)
- [ ] Implement request validation
- [ ] Add error handling middleware
- [ ] Create response serialization

### 1.5 Backend Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for core services
- [ ] Create API endpoint tests
- [ ] Test database operations
- [ ] Implement latency measurement

## Phase 2: iOS App Development (Swift)

### 2.1 Initial Setup
- [ ] Create new Xcode project (iOS App with SwiftUI)
```bash
cd ios_app
# Create via Xcode UI or xcrun command
```
- [ ] Configure project settings:
  - Target iOS 15+
  - Bundle identifier
  - Display name
  - Required permissions (microphone)
- [ ] Set up SwiftUI project structure:
  - Views/
  - Models/
  - ViewModels/
  - Services/
  - Utilities/

### 2.2 Core Infrastructure
- [ ] Add Swift packages:
  - Alamofire (optional for networking)
  - Whisper Swift package (for on-device transcription)
  - Keychain wrapper (for API key storage)
- [ ] Create app configuration and environment settings
- [ ] Implement API service for backend communication
- [ ] Set up error handling and logging

### 2.3 UI Development
- [ ] Design and implement main chat interface:
  - Message list
  - Input field
  - Voice recording button
  - Settings button
- [ ] Create settings view:
  - API configuration
  - Voice settings
  - App preferences
- [ ] Implement user authentication screens
- [ ] Add loading and error states

### 2.4 Voice Processing
- [ ] Implement microphone access and recording
- [ ] Set up AVAudioSession correctly
- [ ] Create voice-to-text service:
  - Use Speech framework or Whisper
  - Handle transcription results
- [ ] Implement text-to-speech using AVSpeechSynthesizer
- [ ] Add audio playback controls

### 2.5 Chat Functionality
- [ ] Create data models for conversations and messages
- [ ] Implement local storage using CoreData
- [ ] Set up message sending and receiving
- [ ] Add conversation context management
- [ ] Implement UI updates for new messages

### 2.6 iOS App Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for core services
- [ ] Test UI interactions
- [ ] Measure and optimize performance
- [ ] Create debug UI for latency monitoring

## Phase 3: Integration

### 3.1 Backend-Frontend Integration
- [ ] Connect iOS app to backend API
- [ ] Test end-to-end communication
- [ ] Implement error handling for network issues
- [ ] Add offline capabilities and sync

### 3.2 Speech-to-Speech Flow
- [ ] Optimize the end-to-end flow:
  1. User speaks
  2. Transcription (on-device or server)
  3. Send to LLM
  4. Receive response
  5. Convert to speech
- [ ] Measure and reduce latency at each step
- [ ] Add visual feedback during processing

### 3.3 Feature Testing
- [ ] Test the complete voice conversation flow
- [ ] Verify text chat functionality
- [ ] Ensure context is maintained across conversations
- [ ] Check performance on different devices

## Phase 4: Refinement and Deployment

### 4.1 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Analyze and optimize backend response times
- [ ] Improve frontend rendering performance
- [ ] Reduce battery consumption
- [ ] Implement caching strategies

### 4.2 User Experience Enhancements
- [ ] Add onboarding flow for new users
- [ ] Improve error messages and recovery
- [ ] Polish UI animations and transitions
- [ ] Ensure accessibility compliance

### 4.3 Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Backend deployment:
  - Set up production environment
  - Configure database
  - Set up monitoring
- [ ] iOS app submission:
  - Prepare App Store assets
  - Complete App Store Connect setup
  - Submit for review

## Next Steps (Post-MVP)

### Enhancements for Future Versions
- [ ] Implement always-listening mode
- [ ] Add iOS 18 Vocal Shortcuts integration
- [ ] Support for multiple LLM providers
- [ ] Enhanced conversation context with RAG
- [ ] Add custom AI personas/roles
- [ ] Implement subscription model
- [ ] Cross-platform support
