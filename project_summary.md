# ChatBuddy iOS App - Project Summary

### Architecture
- Established a well-organized, modular directory structure
- Created protocols for service abstraction (LLM, STT, TTS)
- Developed concrete service implementations:
  - AppleSpeechService for speech recognition
  - AppleTTSService for text-to-speech
  - OpenAIService for LLM integration

### Core Infrastructure
- Implemented permissions management
- Set up settings persistence
- Created view models with service integration
- Added error handling mechanisms

### User Interface
- Designed and implemented chat interface with message bubbles
- Created settings screen with provider selection options
- Added voice selection capabilities
- Implemented push-to-talk button with visual feedback
- Developed onboarding flow with permission requests

### Other
- Implemented real voice selection from device capabilities
- Added API key management for LLM providers
- Set up UserDefaults for settings persistence

## Next Steps

Our immediate priorities are:

1. **Set Up API Keys**
   - OpenAI API key for LLM functionality
   - (Future) API keys for additional providers (Anthropic, ElevenLabs)

2. **Implement Persistence Layer**
   - Add CoreData for chat history storage
   - Implement chat context management

3. **Complete Push-to-Talk Functionality**
   - Test and refine speech recognition integration
   - Ensure smooth audio recording and transcription

4. **Additional Service Providers**
   - Implement Whisper API service (requires OpenAI API key)
   - Implement ElevenLabs TTS service (requires ElevenLabs API key)
   - Implement Anthropic service (requires Anthropic API key)

5. **Testing and Refinement**
   - Test on multiple devices
   - Optimize for performance
   - Add proper error handling and recovery

## API Key Requirements

To fully utilize ChatBuddy, the following API keys will be needed:

1. **OpenAI API Key**
   - Required for: LLM functionality (GPT models) and Whisper API (if selected for STT)
   - How to obtain: 
     - Visit [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
     - Create an account or log in
     - Navigate to the API section
     - Generate a new API key
   - Expected cost: Pay-as-you-go based on usage

2. **Anthropic API Key (Future)**
   - Required for: Alternative LLM provider (Claude models)
   - How to obtain:
     - Visit [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
     - Create an account or log in
     - Navigate to API Keys
     - Generate a new API key
   - Expected cost: Pay-as-you-go based on usage

3. **ElevenLabs API Key (Future)**
   - Required for: High-quality text-to-speech
   - How to obtain:
     - Visit [elevenlabs.io](https://elevenlabs.io)
     - Create an account or log in
     - Go to profile settings
     - Generate a new API key
   - Expected cost: Subscription or pay-as-you-go

## Technical Debt

Areas that will need attention:

1. **Security**
   - Move API key storage to Keychain (currently UserDefaults)
   - Implement proper credential management

2. **Error Handling**
   - Add more comprehensive error handling
   - Implement retry mechanisms for network failures

3. **Accessibility**
   - Add VoiceOver support
   - Ensure proper accessibility labels and hints

4. **Background Mode**
   - Research iOS background audio session capabilities
   - Implement battery-efficient background listening (iOS 18 Vocal Shortcuts)
